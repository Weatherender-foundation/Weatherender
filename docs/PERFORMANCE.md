# Performance Testing

Load testing is done with [k6](https://k6.io/). Scripts live in `load_tests/`.

## Strategy

Two environments are used, on purpose:

- **Smoke & load tests** run against the **live Render deployment** (`weather-7icc.onrender.com`), with a conservative number of virtual users (VUs). This gives real-world numbers — actual network latency, free-tier CPU limits, cold-start behavior — without risking the free-tier infrastructure. Note that `/api/v2/weather` enforces a rate limit of **25 requests/min per IP** via `slowapi`, so live load tests are tuned to run below this threshold to avoid false-positive HTTP 429 errors.
- **Stress & spike tests** run only **locally** against `docker compose` (`localhost:5001` for sync `web`, `localhost:8001` for async `api`), without third-party resource caps. The application rate limiters remain active, so these tests deliberately exercise both normal responses and `429` responses (see "Rate-Limiting-Aware Re-run" below).

> **CI test:** `load_tests/ci_smoke.js` is run by `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as a short smoke check.

| Script            | Target                  | VUs (peak) | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `smoke.js`        | Render (prod)             | 5          | Confirm the deployed sync app is alive and stable |
| `load.js`         | Render (prod)             | 10         | Realistic sync traffic across all v1 endpoints |
| `stress.js`       | Local (docker-compose)    | 40         | Find the sync stack's breaking point, ramped gradually |
| `spike.js`        | Local (docker-compose)    | 50         | Sudden traffic burst against the sync stack, check recovery |
| `smoke_v2.js`     | Render (prod)             | 5          | Confirm the deployed async `/api/v2/*` stack is alive |
| `load_v2.js`      | Render (prod)             | 10         | Realistic async traffic against `/api/v2/*` |
| `stress_v2.js`    | Local (docker-compose)    | 40         | Find the async stack's breaking point, ramped gradually |
| `spike_v2.js`     | Local (docker-compose)    | 50         | Sudden traffic burst against the async stack, check recovery |

All v1 scripts hit three endpoints per iteration: `/health` (touches the DB), `/api/ping` (no DB, no external call), and `/api/weather?city=<random>` (external WeatherAPI call + Redis cache, random city per iteration to force cache misses; also writes a `WeatherRequest` row on every outcome, success or failure). The v2 scripts mirror this with two groups — `/api/v2/health` and `/api/v2/weather?city=<random>` — since the async stack has no `/api/ping`-equivalent no-DB endpoint.

> **Methodology note:** all sections below up to "Rate-Limiting-Aware Re-run" predate the stress/spike scripts' own success checks being updated to reflect rate limiting on `/api/v2/weather` (`slowapi`, added 2026-08-26) and `/api/weather` (`flask-limiter`). At the time these numbers were captured, `429 Too Many Requests` was not an expected response in `stress.js`/`spike.js`/`stress_v2.js`/`spike_v2.js` and counted as a failure — even though a `429` from your own rate limiter under high concurrency is the system working correctly, not breaking. This inflates the historical `checks_failed`/`http_req_failed` figures below relative to what the application actually sustains. See "Rate-Limiting-Aware Re-run" for numbers that treat `200`/`429` as equally successful outcomes.

## Smoke Test (Render)

5 VUs, 50s. Baseline sanity check before anything else.

- `checks_succeeded`: 100%
- `http_req_duration`: avg 372ms, p(95) 387ms
- `http_req_failed`: 0%

No issues — confirms the deployed `/health` endpoint is reachable and responsive under light load.

## Load Test (Render) — Investigating a Bottleneck

10 VUs, ~1m40s, hitting all three endpoints with randomized cities.

### Baseline (sync Gunicorn workers, 4 workers)

- `http_req_duration`: avg 993ms, p(95) 877ms, **max 21.96s**
- `checks_failed`: 7.35%
- `http_req_failed`: 9.80%
- Errors: `connection reset by peer` across all three endpoints — not slow responses, but dropped connections.

**Hypothesis:** Gunicorn's default `sync` worker class blocks one request per worker. With only 4 workers and 10 concurrent VUs (each firing 3 requests per iteration), requests queue up and the Render proxy times out waiting for a response, killing the connection. Render's free tier (~0.1 vCPU) compounds this.

### Fix 1 — Switch to gevent workers

Changed Gunicorn's worker class to `gevent` (`--worker-class gevent --worker-connections 50`), which lets each worker handle many requests concurrently instead of blocking on I/O.

**Result:**
- `http_req_duration`: avg **196ms** (5x better), p(95) **380ms** (2x better), max **1.83s** (12x better)
- `checks_failed`: **3.69%** (down from 7.35%)
- `http_req_failed`: **7.39%**
- `iterations` completed in the same time window: 230 vs 136 (+70%)

Clear, significant win. Most of the catastrophic multi-second outliers disappeared.

### Fix 2 — psycogreen (patch psycopg2 for gevent)

`gevent`'s monkey-patching doesn't cover `psycopg2` (a C extension with its own blocking I/O), so DB calls could still block an entire worker even under gevent. Added `psycogreen` to explicitly patch `psycopg2` for gevent compatibility.

**Result:** no meaningful change (`checks_failed` 2.85%, `http_req_failed` 5.70% — within normal run-to-run variance seen across repeated identical runs, e.g. 7.35% / 3.69% / 4.78% for the same gevent-only build).

**Conclusion:** the gevent switch itself was the fix; psycopg2's lack of a gevent patch was not a meaningful bottleneck here, likely because `/health`'s DB call (`SELECT 1`) is too cheap to matter. The remaining ~3-6% error rate on Render appears to be baseline noise from the free-tier host (shared CPU, proxy timeouts), not something fixable in application code.

## Stress Test (Local) — Historical, pre-rate-limiting methodology

Gradual ramp: 10 → 20 → 30 → 40 VUs, 30s per step, against `localhost:5001` (docker-compose, gevent workers).

- `http_req_duration`: avg 15ms, p(95) 29ms, max 667ms — an order of magnitude faster than Render, as expected without network latency or CPU throttling.
- `checks_failed`: **2.98%**
- `http_req_failed`: **5.97%**

Even with no network or CPU constraints, a small but consistent error rate remains at higher concurrency (30-40 VUs). Two hypotheses were tested and ruled out:

1. **SQLAlchemy connection pool exhaustion** — increased `pool_size` from the default (5) to 10, with `max_overflow=20`. Result: **no change** (`checks_failed` 3.08%, within noise). Kept anyway as safe headroom (see [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md)).
2. **Gunicorn worker count** — kept at `-w 4` (the number these benchmarks were run against): since the connection-pool fix (a more direct lever) had zero effect, and CPU wasn't the constraint locally, increasing the worker count further seemed unlikely to help either. `-w 4` is also what's running in production, via `WEB/Dockerfile`'s `CMD` (Render has no separate start command override), so the numbers documented here match what's actually deployed.

**Conclusion:** the ~3-6% error rate at 30-40+ concurrent VUs appears to be an architectural ceiling of the current sync-code-on-gevent-workers approach (context-switch overhead, OS-level TCP backlog), not a config value that can be tuned away. **Caveat (added later):** at the time of this run, `stress.js` did not yet treat `429` as a success — some fraction of this "error rate" may reflect the rate limiter correctly rejecting excess traffic rather than a genuine architectural ceiling. See "Rate-Limiting-Aware Re-run" below for a cleaner signal.

## Spike Test (Local) — Historical, pre-rate-limiting methodology

Sudden burst: 5 → 50 VUs in 5 seconds, held for 20s, then back down to 5.

- `http_req_duration`: avg 17ms, p(95) 32ms, max 348ms
- `checks_failed`: **2.74%**
- `http_req_failed`: **5.49%**

Nearly identical to the stress test's numbers at a similar VU count. **The application shows no special fragility to sudden traffic spikes** — the error rate tracks the absolute concurrency level, not how quickly that level was reached. Degradation is linear and predictable, not a cliff. Same caveat as above: `429` was counted as failure at the time.

## Async API v2 Testing — A Counter-Intuitive Result (Historical, pre-rate-limiting methodology)

With `/api/v2/*` merged into the Render deployment (see [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md)'s single-image `WSGIMiddleware` setup), the same four-test methodology was run against the async FastAPI stack, before `slowapi` rate limiting existed on `/api/v2/weather`. **The expectation, based on the v1 investigation above, was that a true async stack would outperform sync-on-gevent.** The initial results said otherwise.

### Smoke Test v2 (Render) — Initial Run

5 VUs, 50s, `/api/v2/health` only.

- `checks_succeeded`: 100%
- `http_req_duration`: avg 620ms, p(95) 623ms
- `http_req_failed`: 0%

Confirms the deployed async stack is reachable after the merge — no regressions at light load. Note the baseline latency (~620ms avg) is already notably higher than v1's smoke baseline (~372ms avg) even at this trivial load.

### Load Test v2 (Render) — Initial Run

10 VUs, `/api/v2/health` + `/api/v2/weather?city=<random>`.

- `http_req_duration`: avg 604ms, p(95) 803ms, max 2.39s
- `checks_failed`: 4.29%
- `http_req_failed`: 8.59%

Compared to v1's best result on the same test (gevent + psycogreen): avg 196ms, p(95) 380ms, max 1.13s, `http_req_failed` 5.70%. v2 was slower and less reliable than v1 on identical infrastructure — roughly 3x the latency and ~1.5x the error rate.

### Stress Test v2 (Local) — Initial Run

Gradual ramp 10 → 40 VUs, `localhost:8001`.

- `http_req_duration`: avg 10.48ms, p(95) 18.39ms, max 733ms
- `checks_failed`: 4.18%
- `http_req_failed`: 8.36%

Local average latency was comparable to v1's local stress test, but `http_req_failed` was meaningfully higher than v1's 5.97%.

### Spike Test v2 (Local) — Initial Run

Sudden burst 5 → 50 VUs, `localhost:8001`.

- `http_req_duration`: avg 14.91ms, p(95) 18.04ms, **max 4.17s**
- `checks_failed`: 4.56%
- `http_req_failed`: 9.13%

Average latency stayed low, but max latency (4.17s) was ~12x worse than v1's local spike max (348ms) — the worst single result across every test run, sync or async.

### Root Cause & Fix — Async Engine Pool Starvation (Partial Fix)

`API/async_db.py`'s `create_async_engine(ASYNC_DATABASE_URL)` was called with no explicit `pool_size`/`max_overflow`, unlike the sync engine in `models.py` (`pool_size=10, max_overflow=20`, raised during the v1 investigation above). SQLAlchemy's async engine defaults to `pool_size=5, max_overflow=10` — half the sync engine's configured headroom — while being tested at equal or higher concurrency (40–50 VUs for stress/spike).

**Fix applied:**
```python
engine = create_async_engine(
    ASYNC_DATABASE_URL,
    pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=20,
)
```

**Before / after (same scripts, re-run after the fix, still under the historical pre-rate-limiting methodology):**

| Test            | Metric            | Before | After  | Change |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Smoke (Render)  | http_req_failed    | 0%     | 0.81%  | negligible (1/122 requests; sample size too small to call a trend) |
| Load (Render)   | http_req_failed    | 8.59%  | 11.52% | worse — likely Render free-tier run-to-run noise (v1's gevent runs showed 7.35/3.69/4.78% variance across repeats), not yet confirmed with a repeat run |
| Stress (local)  | http_req_failed    | 8.36%  | 8.21%  | no meaningful change |
| Spike (local)   | max duration       | 4.17s  | **56.89ms** | **~73x better** |
| Spike (local)   | http_req_failed    | 9.13%  | 7.56%  | improved |

**Conclusion:** the pool-sizing fix directly resolves the worst symptom observed — catastrophic tail latency under a sudden traffic spike — confirming pool exhaustion as a real, contributing cause. It does **not** fully close the gap with v1's error rate under sustained load; v2 still ran a few points higher than v1's ~3–6% baseline at the time, and the Render load result got worse rather than better (most likely host-side noise, not yet isolated). This was tracked as **partially resolved**, not closed — see the rate-limiting-aware re-run below, which supersedes this comparison for stress/spike.

### Remaining Candidates for the Residual Gap

1. **`httpx.AsyncClient` connection limits.** ~~The shared client in `API/main.py`'s `lifespan` is constructed with no explicit `httpx.Limits(...)`.~~ **Resolved (informational):** limits are now set explicitly (`max_connections=100, max_keepalive_connections=20`), matching httpx's own defaults — done to rule this variable out, not expected to change behavior.
2. **Render-side noise.** The Load v2 regression (8.59% → 11.52%) still needs 2-3 repeat runs before concluding it's real rather than free-tier variance, following the same practice used for the v1 gevent numbers. Not yet done.
3. **`WSGIMiddleware` presence.** Not yet isolated whether merely importing/mounting `WEB.app` inside the same process has any measurable effect on the async routes, even when a test run never calls a sync route directly. Not yet done.
4. **SlowAPI rate limiting on v2 routes (now understood, not a residual mystery).** `/api/v2/weather` is constrained to 25 requests/min per IP (`/api/weather` similarly via `flask-limiter`). Under the historical methodology above, requests rejected with `429` during high-VU stress/spike tests were counted as failures, inflating `http_req_failed` for both stacks. This is addressed directly below.

## Rate-Limiting-Aware Re-run (Stress & Spike, v1 + v2)

After confirming both `/api/weather` (`flask-limiter`) and `/api/v2/weather` (`slowapi`) enforce **25 requests/minute per IP per worker** (see [`API.md`](API.md)'s Rate Limiting section), `stress.js`, `spike.js`, `stress_v2.js`, and `spike_v2.js` were updated to treat **both `200` and `429`** as expected, successful responses. A `429` under 40-50 concurrent VUs is the rate limiter doing its job correctly — not the application breaking — so counting it as a failure was double-penalizing the stack for a feature working as designed.

**These numbers are not directly comparable to the historical sections above**, which predate this change and counted every `429` as an error.

| Test       | Stack    | Expected Status | Avg Duration | p(95) Duration | Max Duration | Status Check Pass |
|------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Stress     | v1 sync  | 200 / 429       | 6.53ms       | 13.22ms         | 801.79ms      | 97.36%             |
| Stress v2  | v2 async | 200 / 429       | 6.38ms       | 12.52ms         | 613.00ms      | 95.71%             |
| Spike      | v1 sync  | 200 / 429       | 5.49ms       | 12.18ms         | 27.09ms       | 97.20%             |
| Spike v2   | v2 async | 200 / 429       | 6.26ms       | 12.27ms         | 24.92ms       | 95.42%             |

**Reading this table:** with `200`/`429` both counted as success, the *remaining* "check fail" percentage (~3-5%) represents genuine failures — connection errors, timeouts, unexpected status codes — not rate-limiter rejections. This is a materially cleaner signal than the historical numbers above, which conflated "the rate limiter is working" with "the system is failing." Both stacks land in a similar, tight band (~95-97% pass) at this concurrency, once measured this way — the earlier "v2 has an 8-9% residual error gap" framing was partly an artifact of the old methodology, not purely an architectural regression. **Note:** Smoke and Load (both v1 and v2) have not yet been re-run under this methodology — they remain under the historical (429-as-failure) accounting above, since they run at lower concurrency against Render and haven't been observed tripping the rate limiter in practice.

## Historical Summary (pre-rate-limiting methodology)

| Test                          | Environment | Stack    | checks_failed | http_req_failed | avg duration | max duration |
|--------------------------------|-------------|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Smoke                          | Render      | v1 sync  | 0%             | 0%               | 372ms         | —             |
| Smoke v2                       | Render      | v2 async | 0.40%          | 0.81%            | 693ms         | 2.39s         |
| Load (sync workers)            | Render      | v1 sync  | 7.35%          | 9.80%            | 993ms         | 21.96s        |
| Load (gevent + psycogreen)     | Render      | v1 sync  | 2.85%          | 5.70%            | 196ms         | 1.13s         |
| Load v2 (after pool fix)       | Render      | v2 async | 5.76%          | 11.52%           | 601.51ms      | 2.53s         |
| Stress (gradual ramp)          | Local       | v1 sync  | 2.98%          | 5.97%            | 15ms          | 667ms         |
| Stress v2 (after pool fix)     | Local       | v2 async | 4.10%          | 8.21%            | 9.18ms        | 1.01s         |
| Spike (sudden burst)           | Local       | v1 sync  | 2.74%          | 5.49%            | 17ms          | 348ms         |
| Spike v2 (after pool fix)      | Local       | v2 async | 3.78%          | 7.56%            | 7.33ms        | **56.89ms**   |

**Key takeaways:**
- Switching Gunicorn from `sync` to `gevent` workers was the single highest-impact fix for v1, cutting worst-case latency by ~12x and error rate roughly in half on the Render deployment.
- Neither `psycogreen` nor a larger SQLAlchemy connection pool moved the needle for v1 locally under the historical methodology.
- The async v2 stack initially showed a *higher* error rate and worse tail latency than v1 under the historical methodology — the assumption "async is automatically faster" did not hold at first.
- Sizing the async SQLAlchemy engine's connection pool to match the sync engine (`pool_size=10, max_overflow=20`) fixed the worst symptom (spike max latency: 4.17s → 56.89ms).
- **Once `429` is correctly treated as a successful rate-limiter response rather than a failure** (see "Rate-Limiting-Aware Re-run" above), v1 and v2 show comparable, tight pass rates (~95-97%) under local stress/spike — most of the apparent "v2 is worse" gap in the historical numbers reflects rate-limiter rejections, not a genuine architectural disadvantage of the async stack.
- Render-side Load v2 noise and `WSGIMiddleware` overhead remain open, unconfirmed questions — not yet re-tested under the corrected methodology.
