   * A brief description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
   * Step-by-step instructions or a Proof of Concept (PoC) to reproduce the issue.
   * Suggested mitigation or fix (if available).

### Response Timeline:
* **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an initial response within **48 hours** confirming receipt of your report.

## Security Practices in Weatherender

This project enforces several production-level security safeguards:
* **Header Hardening**: HTTP response headers managed via `flask-talisman` (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options).
* **Rate Limiting**: Protected against abuse via `Flask-Limiter` on the web route, `/api/weather`, and `/api/apispec.json`, plus `SlowAPI` on `/api/v2/weather`.
* **Input Validation**: Request payloads sanitized and validated with `Marshmallow` schemas.
* **Automated CI Scanning**: Code quality and security linter checks (`Ruff`, `Mypy`) enforced via GitHub Actions.
