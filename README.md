## Live Demo

> The application is currently in a fully stable, containerized, and production-grade state. It will remain active and autonomously maintained in the cloud.

**[weather-7icc.onrender.com](https://weather-7icc.onrender.com)**

> **Infrastructure Note:** Hosted on the Render free tier. To bypass the default 15-minute spin-down restriction, the application is kept active via a dedicated background automated worker ([UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)) targeting the lightweight database-free `/api/ping` endpoint every 10 minutes.

### Availability and Known Limitations

- **Cold Starts:** Despite the cron-ping system, occasional "cold starts" (30–50s delays) may still occur due to Render's internal container recycling or rare service interruptions.
- **Database Pauses:** The production storage operates on a free Supabase instance. If the database receives absolutely no client traffic for 7+ consecutive days, Supabase will automatically pause the project. If this occurs, feel free to open an issue to request a manual wake-up.

Stack in production: Render (app) + Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Upstash (Redis).

## Install

### Python package (CLI)

```bash
pip install weatherender
weatherender
```

Requires Python 3.13+ and a configured `.env`. At minimum you'll need:
- `WEATHER_API_KEY` — free key from [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- `SECRET_KEY` — generate with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
- `DATABASE_URL` — a reachable PostgreSQL instance; the CLI logs every request (success or failure) to it

Simply importing the package (e.g. as a dependency, or via tooling) does **not** require any of these — they're only needed to actually run `weatherender`.

### Docker image (API)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/weatherender-foundation/weatherender-api:latest
```

For the full local stack (web + api + postgres + redis) use Docker Compose below.

## Features

- 🌦 Current weather + 3-day forecast via [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- ❄️ Advanced Snow Surface Condition Index(SSCI): a unique algorithmic snow condition and quality detection system (featuring statuses like *Dry champagne powder!*, *Ice crust*, *Spring slush*, *Wind slab*, etc.). The analysis evaluates diurnal temperature cycles, wind speed, snow density, and 24-hour precipitation metrics.
- 🖥 Web interface (Flask) and CLI tool, sharing a common service/model layer
- 📍 Automatic city detection by IP (with fallback chain: ip-api.com → ipinfo.io)
- 🗄 PostgreSQL persistence via SQLAlchemy + Alembic migrations
- 🧹 Automated DB cleanup: background storage rotation powered by `APScheduler` (running weekly with a file-lock mechanism to prevent duplicate worker triggers) to safely stay within DB limits
- ✅ Input validation with Marshmallow (sync) and Pydantic v2 (async)
- 🛡️ Resilience & retries (`tenacity`): exponential backoff wrapper for upstream WeatherAPI calls (synchronous for v1 Flask `requests`, asynchronous non-blocking for v2 FastAPI `httpx`)
- 🚦 Rate limiting & protection: granular per-worker rate limiting (`flask-limiter` for v1, `slowapi` for v2), confirmed experimentally via `scripts/check_limit.sh` (400 sequential requests, graceful `429 Too Many Requests` degradation beyond the quota)
- 🐳 Fully containerized with Docker Compose
- 🐬 Docker image on GHCR: [`ghcr.io/weatherender-foundation/weatherender-api`](https://github.com/Weatherender-foundation/Weatherender/pkgs/container/weatherender-api)
- 🐍 Published on PyPI: [`pip install weatherender`](https://pypi.org/project/weatherender/)
- 🔄 CI/CD via GitHub Actions (build, migrate, health check, image publish)
- 🧪 158+ automated tests (pytest): unit, mocked service, Flask & FastAPIroute, and real PostgreSQL integration tests
- 🔌 JSON REST API (`/api/weather` and `/api/v2/weather`) with interactive Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- ⚡️ Redis caching for WeatherAPI responses (TTL-based, graceful fallback on Redis unavailability)
- 📊 Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) for observability
- ❤️ Readiness health check (`/health`) with Docker/Compose integration
- 🔒 Security hardening: secure headers (Talisman), request size limits, User-Agent validation
- 📝 Structured JSON logging
- 🚀 Load-tested with [k6](https://k6.io/) (smoke, load, stress, spike) — see [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md)
- ☁️ Production cloud deployment: hosted on Render, integrated with Supabase (PostgreSQL) and Upstash (Redis), featuring an automated heartbeat worker ([UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)) to maintain 24/7 web service availability

## Quick Start (Docker)

> Prefer not to run it locally? Try the [live demo](https://weather-7icc.onrender.com) above.

1. Clone the repo and copy the environment template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Weatherender-foundation/Weatherender.git
cd Weatherender
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Fill in `.env` — at minimum you'll need a free API key from [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) (`WEATHER_API_KEY`) and a `SECRET_KEY`:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

3. Start the stack:

> Make sure Docker Desktop is installed

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose run --rm cli alembic upgrade head
```

4. Open [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) for the Flask-only process (UI + sync API).

   Open [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) for the combined process: FastAPI v2 **and** the same Flask app mounted via `WSGIMiddleware` (this is what production runs). Docs: [http://localhost:8001/v2/docs](http://localhost:8001/v2/docs).

Local ports (from `.env.example`):

| Service | Host port | Serves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web` | `5001` | Gunicorn + Flask only (UI, `/api/weather`, `/health`, `/apidocs`) |
| `api` | `8001` | Uvicorn + FastAPI + Flask mounted (v2 **and** v1/UI) |
| PostgreSQL | `5432` | — |
| Redis | `6379` | — |
| Test PostgreSQL | `5433` | — |


## Running the CLI

Via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose run --rm cli weatherender
# or:
docker compose run --rm cli python -m weatherender.CLI.main
```

Via the PyPI package (after `pip install weatherender` and a local `.env`):

```bash
weatherender
```

## API

The app exposes a JSON REST API alongside the web UI.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/v2/weather` | GET | High-performance async API v2 with Pydantic validation (rate limited: 25 req/min) |
| `/api/v2/health` | GET | Async DB health check |
| `/v2/redoc` | GET | Alternative FastAPI ReDoc documentation |
| `/v2/docs` | GET | Interactive FastAPI OpenAPI/Swagger documentation |
| `/api/weather` | GET | Get current weather + forecast for a city (`?city=Berlin`) |
| `/api/apispec.json` | GET | Raw OpenAPI 3.0 specification (v1) |
| `/health` | GET | Readiness check (verifies DB connectivity) |
| `/metrics` | GET | Prometheus metrics |
| `/api/ping` | GET | Ping endpoint for uptime monitors (no DB connection) |
| `/apidocs` | GET | Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation (v1) |

> `/api/weather` and `/api/v2/weather` responses are cached in Redis for 5 minutes (configurable via `REDIS_TTL`). If Redis is unavailable, the app falls back to fetching fresh data from WeatherAPI directly.

Full reference: [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md).

## Performance & Caching Strategy

To ensure high performance and minimize reliance on external services, the application implements a multi-layered caching and optimization architecture:

- **Redis Integration:** Weather data fetched from WeatherAPI is cached in an Upstash Redis instance with a 5-minute TTL (`REDIS_TTL`). Subsequent requests for the same city are served instantly from the cache, saving external API quotas.
- **Graceful Degradation:** If the Redis instance becomes temporarily unavailable, the application automatically catches the exception and gracefully falls back to direct API fetching without disrupting the user experience.
- **Database Efficiency:** The automated uptime monitor triggers a lightweight `/api/ping` route that does not open SQLAlchemy sessions or hit the database. This prevents creating redundant connections on the free Supabase tier, keeping the connection pool clean.

## Performance Testing

The application has been load, stress, and spike tested with [k6](https://k6.io/) — both against the live Render deployment and locally via Docker Compose. Full methodology and results, including a real bottleneck investigation (sync → gevent Gunicorn workers), are documented in [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md). Scripts live in `load_tests/`.

### Running Load Tests Locally

k6 must be installed locally (it isn't bundled as a Docker Compose service). Smoke and load tests target the live Render deployment directly; stress and spike tests require the local stack running first.

#### 1. Smoke Test (Render — verify the live deployment is alive and stable)

```bash
k6 run load_tests/smoke.js
```

#### 2. Load Test (Render — realistic traffic across all endpoints)

```bash
k6 run load_tests/load.js
```

#### 3. Stress Test (local — find the system's breaking point) — [running locally](#quick-start-docker)

```bash
docker compose up -d
k6 run load_tests/stress.js
```

#### 4. Spike Test (local — validate resilience against sudden traffic bursts) — [running locally](#quick-start-docker)

```bash
docker compose up -d
k6 run load_tests/spike.js
```

## Running Tests

Tests require a dedicated PostgreSQL test container (kept separate from the dev/prod database):

```bash
docker compose up -d weather_test_db
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://test_user:test_password@localhost:5433/test_weather_db" alembic upgrade head
pytest -v
```

Via Compose (same path as CI):

```bash
docker compose run --rm -v "$PWD":/app cli pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=xml --asyncio-mode=auto
```

Note: `test_cache.py` mocks the Redis client directly and does not require a running Redis instance.

## Engineering Standards & Git Flow

This repository strictly adheres to professional enterprise software development practices:

- **Feature Branching:** Every bug fix, optimization, and component expansion is developed in isolated branches (`feature/*`, `fix/*`) to ensure the `main` branch remains stable and deployable at all times.
- **True Merging:** The project utilizes explicit merge commits via the `--no-ff` (no fast-forward) strategy to preserve a rich, readable, and non-linear history of architectural iterations.
- **Conventional Commits:** Commit messages are standardized using semantic prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `tests:`) to provide transparency in project growth and documentation maintenance.
- **Issue-Driven Post-Mortems:** Real infrastructure incidents and complex bug fixes are documented in the repository's closed Issues as production post-mortems, tracking root cause analysis and technical resolutions.
- **Automated CI/CD & Safe Deployment:** Completely automated integration via GitHub Actions. The workflow forces strict validation layers (Ruff linting, Mypy type-checking, and full Pytest execution) before triggering a production release. Automated deployment via Render webhooks is strictly gated and will automatically block if any unit test or linting check fails.

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

The next major architectural evolution of **Weatherender** is fully planned:

- [ ] **Dynamic Radar Maps:** Integrate interactive precipitation radar and dynamic weather maps using GIS/Leaflet tools to visualize snow and rain fronts
- [x] **Asynchronous API v2 (FastAPI Integration):** High-performance `api/v2` microservice using **FastAPI** (`asyncio`, `asyncpg`, `httpx`, `Pydantic v2`) mounted alongside Flask via `WSGIMiddleware`
- [x] **Python package & GHCR image:** Installable `weatherender` on PyPI and published API image on GitHub Container Registry
- [ ] **User Authentication & Custom Alerts:** Implement secure JWT or session-based user authentication via Supabase Auth, allowing skiers to save favorite resorts and customize automated notification limits

See full roadmap [here](docs/ROADMAP.md)

## Project Structure & Architecture

The installable package lives under `src/weatherender/`:

```text
src/weatherender/
├── WEB/          # Flask UI + v1 JSON API (Compose `web`, port 5001 — Flask only)
├── API/          # FastAPI v2 + mounted Flask (Compose `api` / Render / GHCR, port 8001)
├── CLI/          # console script: weatherender
├── config.py
├── models.py
├── services.py
├── cache.py
├── schemas.py
└── snow.py
```

Locally, Compose runs `web` (port **5001**, Flask only) and `api` (port **8001**, FastAPI + Flask via `WSGIMiddleware`) as separate containers. Production and GHCR use only the API image, so one uvicorn process serves both stacks — the same shape as local `:8001`.

## Engineering Challenges & Bug Investigations

A full technical deep-dive into blockers, edge cases, and architectural updates can be tracked in closed [Project Issues](https://github.com/Weatherender-foundation/Weatherender/issues). Key production-level engineering challenges solved during development include:

### 1. Database Pollution Mitigation & HTTP HEAD Short-Circuiting ([Issue #9](https://github.com/Weatherender-foundation/Weatherender/issues/9))

- **The Incident (Post-Mortem):** Continuous 10-minute uptime checks from [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) targeting the root route (`/`) were heavily polluting the operational logs and telemetry within the Supabase PostgreSQL storage layer, triggering unintended database writes and accumulating thousands of empty automated tracking rows.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The external monitor was explicitly configured to use the `HTTP HEAD` method. However, because Flask by default implicitly converts unhandled `HEAD` requests to `GET` on routes without explicit declaration, the request bypassed custom `User-Agent` string filtering layers. This initiated a redundant `SessionLocal()` DB connection and triggered execution of an unpredictable insert query lifecycle on every health probe.
- **Engineering Solution & Shield:**
  1. Updated the internal `/api/ping` route configuration within `api_routes.py` to explicitly support both `GET` and `HEAD` methods to handle direct infrastructure probes natively.
  2. Overhauled the core index (`/`) route decorator in `app.py` by introducing explicit `HEAD` support (`methods=["GET", "POST", "HEAD"]`).
  3. Placed a high-priority, zero-cost early return check (`if request.method == "HEAD": return ""`) at the very first line of execution.
- **Results:** Database pollution was successfully brought down to **0%**, server resources were completely preserved, and database sessions are now never initialized for non-human monitoring traffic.

### 2. Flask-Limiter Blueprint Registry Mismatch & Circular Dependency Resolution ([Issue #10](https://github.com/Weatherender-foundation/Weatherender/issues/10))

- **The Incident:** During pre-merge manual load testing using a custom `check_limit.sh` script (firing 400 sequential requests), the automated uptime monitor health checks against `/api/ping` consistently failed with `429 Too Many Requests`. The endpoint kept throttling traffic even though an explicit `limiter.exempt(ping)` rule was active in `app.py`.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** A deep-dive revealed a lifecycle mismatch in how `flask-limiter==4.1.1` registers routes. When applying a blueprint-wide limit (`api_bp`), the `@limiter.exempt` decorator failed because it looked up the bare function name, whereas Flask resolves the request's endpoint at dispatch time using the prefixed name (`api.ping`). Furthermore, attempting to apply decorators directly inside `api_routes.py` introduced immediate circular imports between `app.py` and the routing module.
- **Engineering Solution:**
  1. Broke the circular dependency chain by decoupling the `Limiter` instance instantiation, moving it into an uninitialized state inside a newly designed infrastructure layer: `src/weatherender/WEB/extensions.py`.
  2. Late-bound the engine during the application factory setup in `app.py` via `limiter.init_app(app)`.
  3. Dropped the fragile blueprint-wide mapping logic entirely. Instead, explicitly declared per-route limits using `@limiter.limit("25 per minute")` directly on the protected production endpoints (`get_weather` and `get_apispec`), leaving the critical `/api/ping` route cleanly undecorated and inherently immune to rate-limiting blocks.
- **Results:** Re-running the 400-request load test confirmed 100% success on `/api/ping` (returning pure `200 OK` metrics alongside expected gevent network socket resets), while public endpoints correctly isolated and blocked aggressive traffic bursts.
